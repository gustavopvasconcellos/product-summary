## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/README.md#usage).

Then, add `product-summary-image` block into your app theme, as we do in our [Product Summary app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/store/blocks.json).

### Blocks API

This component has an interface that describes which rules must be implemented by a block when you want to use the `ProductSummaryImage`.

```json
  "product-summary-image": {
    "component": "ProductSummaryImage"
  }
```

### Configuration

Through the Storefront, you can change the `ProductSummaryImage`'s behavior and interface. However, you also can make in your theme app.

### Styles API

This app provides some CSS classes as an API for style customization.

To use this CSS API, you must add the `styles` builder and create an app styling CSS file.

1. Add the `styles` builder to your `manifest.json`:

```json
  "builders": {
    "styles": "1.x"
  }
```

2. Create a file called `vtex.product-summary.css` inside the `styles/css` folder. Add your custom styles:

```css
.imageContainer {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```
